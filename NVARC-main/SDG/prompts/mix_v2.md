You are an advanced AI system specialized in creating ARC-AGI (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus - Artificial General Intelligence) puzzles. Your task is to analyze two existing puzzles and create a new puzzle by combining elements from both.

Here are the two puzzles you will be working with:

### First puzzle

<puzzle_1>
{PUZZLE1}
</puzzle_1>

### Second puzzle

<puzzle_2>
{PUZZLE2}
</puzzle_2>

Your objective is to create a new puzzle that incorporates elements from both puzzles and requires compositional reasoning to solve. The first puzzle should be considered as a base, and the second puzzle should be used to inspire new ideas. The new puzzle should maintain the following structure:

1. rules_summary: A concise overview of the puzzle's rules and objectives.
2. input_generation: Description of how the input grids are created.
3. solution_steps: A step-by-step guide on how to solve the puzzle.
4. key_insight: The crucial realization needed to understand and solve the puzzle.
5. puzzle_concepts: A list of the main concepts and skills required to solve the puzzle.

Before creating the new puzzle, please analyze the input puzzles and plan your approach. In this analysis:

1. List out the key elements and rules of each input puzzle separately.
2. Identify common themes or complementary concepts between the two puzzles.
3. Brainstorm potential ways to combine elements from both puzzles.
4. Consider how to increase complexity while still keeping it solvable for humans.

It's OK for this section to be quite long, as thorough analysis will lead to a better final puzzle.

Once you've completed your analysis, present the new puzzle description using the following format:

<new_puzzle>
<rules_summary>
[Concise overview of the new puzzle's rules and objectives]
</rules_summary>

<input_generation>
[Description of how the input grids for the new puzzle are created]
</input_generation>

<solution_steps>
[Step-by-step guide on how to solve the new puzzle]
</solution_steps>

<key_insight>
[The crucial realization needed to understand and solve the new puzzle]
</key_insight>

<puzzle_concepts>
[List of the main concepts and skills required to solve the new puzzle]
</puzzle_concepts>
</new_puzzle>

Remember, the new puzzle should:
1. Mostly based on the first puzzle with additional details from the second puzzle.
2. Combine elements from both input puzzles in a meaningful way.
3. Uses different colors, shapes, object properties and grid sizes.
4. Require compositional reasoning to solve.
5. Be clearly described and solvable by the average person.
6. Adhere to the following constraints:
   - The maximum size of the puzzle grids is 30x30 (height, width).
   - Use only the following 10 colors: 0 - BLACK, 1 - BLUE, 2 - RED, 3 - GREEN, 4 - YELLOW, 5 - GRAY, 6 - MAGENTA, 7 - ORANGE, 8 - SKY, 9 - BROWN.

Please begin by analyzing the input puzzles and planning your approach to modifying the first puzzle using ideas from the second puzzle.
